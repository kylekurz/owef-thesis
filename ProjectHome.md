The Open Word Enumeration Framework (OWEF) is an open-source bioinformatics framework designed to ease the developmental load of creating new software while simultaneously lowering the learning curve for users by providing a consistent user interface and abstracting underlying algorithms. The framework included in this project provides a basic functionality, but is in no way a complete tool. More sophisticated child classes should be added for each of the main parent classes: DataStructure, WordScoring and ClusterMethod to provide useful analysis.
